This function converts COMP_LINE (str) (which can be supplied by zsh from `read
-l`) and COMP_POINT (int) (which can be supplied by zsh from `read -ln`) into
COMP_WORDS (array) and COMP_CWORD (int), like what bash supplies to shell
functions. Currently implemented using `Complete::Bash`'s `parse_cmdline`.

        cmdline => {
            summary => 'Command-line, defaults to COMP_LINE environment',
            schema => 'str*',
            pos => 0,
        },
    },
    result => {
        schema => ['array*', len=>2],
        description => <<'_',

Return a 2-element array: `[$words, $cword]`. `$words` is array of str,
equivalent to `COMP_WORDS` provided by bash to shell functions. `$cword` is an
integer, equivalent to `COMP_CWORD` provided by bash to shell functions. The
word to be completed is at `$words->[$cword]`.

Note that COMP_LINE includes the command name. If you want the command-line
arguments only (like in `@ARGV`), you need to strip the first element from
`$words` and reduce `$cword` by 1.

zsh accepts completion reply in the form of one entry per line to STDOUT.
Currently the formatting is done using `Complete::Bash`'s `format_completion`.

        completion => {

Either an array or hash, as described in `Complete`.
